# lamecoin

A new cryptocurrency just made for fun using Python. 

We hope to finish the full cryptocurrency within the next month. For now, test out the blockchain! You can use the blockchain via Postman using multiple nodes. Send any of the HTTP requests listed in 'HTTPServer.py' to communicate between nodes.
