# Lamecoin

A new cryptocurrency just made for fun using Python. 

Lamecoin is a proof-of-concept project and thus is a very simple version of a cryptocurrency. Lamecoin works through allowing different local servers to act like nodes in the cryptocurrency network. These nodes own a blockchain are in charge of making sure that it remains intact and valid, and also are capable of mining new blocks, and initiating transactions between each other. 

Simple HTTP requests between the two main types of nodes: Master Nodes and Client Nodes, form the major interactions in the code in MasterNode.py and ClientNode.py. The other classes are for structuring data like the blockchain or a Client Node's wallet.
